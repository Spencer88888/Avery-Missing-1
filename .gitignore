        <p>Dear Avery,</p>
        <p>Every moment apart feels like an eternity. I miss your smile, your laughter, and the warmth of your presence. The world just doesn't feel the same without you by my side.</p>
        <p>This website is a small token of my love for you and a reminder of how much you mean to me. I can't wait to see you again soon and hold you close.</p>
        <p>Until then, remember that you're always in my thoughts and in my heart. I love you more with each passing day.</p>
